            <h1 id="welcome" class="welcome">Welcome to our website</h1>
            <p>Thanks for showing interest in our website. We are here to help you to loss youe weight with simple ways. There are many tips and we will cover everything about these tips. </p>

            <h2 id="why">Why you have to loss weight?</h2>
            <p>You should have a strong reason for wanting to lose weight. For me it's all about being healthy, happy, and wanting to grow old gracefully and vibrantly. I want to be able to feel good so I can continue to travel and pursue my dreams.</p>

            <h2>Do it your way.</h2>
            <p>It's important to lose weight your way, not someone else's. You need to find changes that you are willing to make forever, not jus for a day or a week or until you've reached your goal.</p>

            <h2>Focus on teeny tiny changes</h2>
            <p>It's much better to commit to a little change that you can actually accomplish regularly than a huge one that you are never able to get done. Years ago one of my favorite yogas told me to "only do as much yoga as feels good" because "a little yoga done often is better than a lot of yoga done rarely." Turns out this is the secret to any lasting behavior change.</p>

                        <p>Using smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls, you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.</p>

                                <li>According to Harvard Health, it’s estimated that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 167 calories per 30 minutes of walking at a moderate pace of 4 mph (6.4 km/h).</li>
                                <li>A 12-week study in 20 women with obesity found that walking for 50–70 minutes 3 times per week reduced body fat and waist circumference by an average of 1.5% and 1.1 inches (2.8 cm), respectively.</li>
                                <li>It’s easy to fit walking into your daily routine. To add more steps to your day, try walking during your lunch break, taking the stairs at work, or taking your dog for extra walks.</li>

                                <li>Although they seem similar, the key difference is that a jogging pace is generally between 4–6 mph (6.4–9.7 km/h), while a running pace is faster than 6 mph (9.7 km/h).                            </li>
                                <li>Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns approximately 298 calories per 30 minutes of jogging at a 5-mph (8-km/h) pace, or 372 calories per 30 minutes of running at a 6-mph (9.7-km/h) pace.</li>
                                <li>What’s more, studies have found that jogging and running can help burn harmful visceral fat, commonly known as belly fat. This type of fat wraps around your internal organs and has been linked to various chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.</li>

                                <li>Not only is cycling great for weight loss, but studies have found that people who cycle regularly have better overall fitness, increased insulin sensitivity, and a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and death, compared with those who don’t cycle regularly.</li>

                                <li>One 12-week study in 24 middle-aged women found that swimming for 60 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced body fat, improved flexibility, and reduced several heart disease risk factors, including high total cholesterol and blood triglycerides (22).</li>
                                <li>Another advantage of swimming is its low-impact nature, meaning that it’s easier on your joints. This makes it a great option for people who have injuries or joint pain.</li>
